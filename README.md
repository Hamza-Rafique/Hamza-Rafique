As a team lead frontend & UI and senior React developer(HTML, CSS, JavaScript Nextjs) at Rapidev, I had the opportunity to work closely with various teams within the organization, including management, the GIS team, the mapping library, as well as the backend and data sciences teams. Through my experiences working with these teams, I gained valuable insight into the overall functioning of the company and its strategic direction. 
#My primary responsibility as a team lead was to guide my team of developers in the design, development, and deployment of various web-based applications using React. Working closely with the management team, I helped to identify business objectives and translate them into technical requirements that my team could deliver. Through regular communication and collaboration with the GIS team, I gained a deeper understanding of how mapping technologies were being utilized within Rapidev and helped to integrate these technologies into our applications. 


### Mid Software Engineer at BIG IMMERSIVE

As a front-end developer, I have worked on multiple projects, including the Virtua product and the Virtua Island project. These projects involved creating a metaverse for selling plots and required the use of various technologies such as web3js, ReactJS, smart-contract, and wallet-integration with MetaMask. I closely collaborated with the blockchain team to ensure seamless integration and also worked closely with project managers to deliver successful projects. My experience in using these technologies and working collaboratively with teams makes me a valuable addition to any development team.
